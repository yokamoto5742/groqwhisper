     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     setx GROQ_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```

     ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
